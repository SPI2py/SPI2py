class System(SystemsValidation):
    """
    Defines the associative (non-spatial) aspects of systems.

    The layout module of SPI2py may map a single System to multiple SpatialConfigurations, performing gradient-based
    optimization on each SpatialConfiguration in parallel.

    This associative information includes things such as which objects to check check for collision between.
    Movement classes and associated constraints dictate which objects have design variables and if those design
    variables are constrained.

    There are four types of objects:
    1. Static:              Objects that cannot move (but must still be mapped to the spatial configuration)
    2. Independent:         Objects that can move independently of each other
    3. Partially Dependent: Objects that are constrained relative to other object(s) but retain some degree of freedom
    4. Fully Dependent:     Objects that are fully constrained to another object (e.g., the port of a component)

    Note: For the time being we will assume that you cannot chain dependencies.
    For example, we may assert that the position of objects B,C, and D may depend directly on A.
    However, we may not assert that the position of object D depends on C, which depends on the position of B.

    TODO Change positions dict from pass-thru edit to merge edit
    TODO Add a method to consistently order all objects based on their dependency chains
    TODO Add a method to check for circular dependencies and overconstrained objects
    TODO Write unit tests to confirm that all property-decorated functions correctly apply filters
