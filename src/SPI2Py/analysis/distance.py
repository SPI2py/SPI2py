"""Distance calculations

Provides functions to calculate the distance between classes in various ways...

TODO I think it makes sense to get rid of the calculate gap function and to work it into the existing functions
    This will require adding the radii as an additional argument. It works now for uniform spheres, but MDBD will
    have different sized spheres.

    Returns the minimum distance between a KD-Tree and object.

    In some cases, we need to check the distance between two sets of points, but one
    set is extremely large (e.g., a complex structure) and thus the number of distance
    calculations combinatorially grows and becomes prohibitive.

    For static structures (e.g., a structure) we can construct a data structure (i.e., KD Tree)
    once and then use it to efficiently perform distance calculations. Since the cost of
    constructing a KD Tree is relatively high, and you must reconstruct it every time positions
    change we do not use this for moving classes.

    This function presumes the KD Tree is created when the object is initialized and thus
    takes the tree as an argument instead of trying to create a tree from points every
    function call.
