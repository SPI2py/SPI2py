layout:

  # The number of random initial layouts and subsequent optimizations
  # Not currently used
  number of solutions: 1


optimization:

  # Solver
  # TODO Add more solvers
  solver: scipy.optimize.minimize

  # Method
  # TODO Add more methods
  method: trust-constr

  # TODO Specify objective function
  # TODO Specify constraint function

  # Tolerances between 1e-1 and 2.5e-1 solve within a reasonable time
  convergence tolerance: 1e-3

  # Specify whether to check for collision between specific pairs
  check collisions:
    components and components: true
    components and interconnects: true
    components and structures: true
    interconnects and interconnects: true
    interconnects and structures: true

  # 0 to 1; 0 means no collision, >0 means some collision
  collision tolerance:
    components and components: 0
    components and interconnects: 0.1
    components and structures: 0
    interconnects and interconnects: 0.1
    interconnects and structures: 0
